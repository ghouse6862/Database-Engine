# Database-Engine
This project was done as part of my CS6360 Database Design course

This is a rudimentary database engine that uses the file-per-table approach to physical store like MySQL. Implemented B+ trees data structures to store, insert, delete, or accommodate the data. 
This Database Engine supports only one database and one user which are used by default. The database engine runs from the command prompt and can execute the following DDL commands (SHOW, CREATE, DROP), DML commands (INSERT INTO, DELETE FROM, UPDATE) and VDL commands (SELECT-FROM-WHERE)
